# What is archaeogenetics?

Archaeogenetics utilizes the recent advances in molecular approaches on biomolecules, such as genome-wide DNA sequencing, to uncover a growing spectrum of information that can be retrieved from sample repositories such as anthropological and archaeological collections, as well as ongoing archaeological excavations. It serves a wide range of knowledge generation, including obtaining detailed information about genetic relationships, geographical origin, natural selective processes or the genetic structure of historic, prehistoric and modern human, plant, animal or even microbial populations.
