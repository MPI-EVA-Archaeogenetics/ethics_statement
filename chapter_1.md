# Accessing human remains

Human remains provide a unique opportunity to study human history and prehistory, which in some cases cannot be reconstructed otherwise, and can present new perspectives on old narratives, as well as uncovering entirely new aspects. At the same time, human remains have spiritual, religious, cultural, and personal value to some communities. This can result in various stakeholders having conflicting interests regarding the need, implementation, and interpretation of genetic studies. How to mediate between these interests is a matter of law, but it also requires careful ethical and cultural considerations. We believe that the treatment of human remains from different cultures must be based on awareness and respect concerning the norms and ideas of their communities of origin.

In the section we want to elaborate on things to consider when working with material from (museum) collections and archaeological fieldwork (section 1.1) and about the interaction with the mentioned communities of origin (section 1.2).

## Human Remains in Museums and Collections

The vast majority of human remains, from archaeological fieldwork or otherwise, are stored in museum- or otherwise publicly or privately organised anthropological collections. Yet especially in the case of archaeogenetic analyses, samples are sometimes taken directly from archaeological fieldwork. While there are special matters to consider for this case, as will be discussed further in section 5, many qus

For the purpose of this chapter, we do not consider these cases to be special, but believe that apart from specific … collaboration, multidipslinary, sectiion 5 ... , the ethical basis for working 

Museums have historically played an important role in procuring and storing human remains as part of collections and aesthetic displays. In addition, private collections also hold large numbers of human remains from various regions of the world, often with less public oversight (cite). The management and the appropriate means of acquisition, collection, care, and display of human remains have changed over time. Still, consensus standards for managing remains may not exist globally, but individual museums and collections have developed their own standards and procedures that undergo occasional revisions with changing trends and norms.

In order to assess ethical implications of research on objects from museums and collections, it is important to understand the history of such collections. In fact, the practice of collecting materials and artifacts in the last five centuries has been driven by multiple factors, including the fascination by the unknown, curiosity, but also arguably by greed and expression of colonial power (Pearson, Schadla-Hall, and Moshenska 2011). Particularly collections compiled during the colonial period often pose ethical questions, especially within light of indigenous rights and post-colonial nations’ movements for repatriation and ownership of their past. However, the ways in which  human remains were acquired during the colonial periods vary in their context and historical settings, and thus require intensive consideration. 

Here we put forward a set of questions to assist researchers in the field of Archaeogenetics to understand the ethical status of a particular museum/collection prior to collaboration.

- What were the motivations, scholarly or otherwise, of the original collectors of the human remains?
If for scholarly purposes, how was that work during the time of material collection carried out? Was it under the auspices of the local administration authorities and indigenous communities if applicable?
- What is the chain of custody of the human remains in question before they arrived at the museum or collection?
- How did the museum/collection acquire the human remains? Through donation or purchase?
- Do the holders of the material perpetuate a particular political agenda, which could be advanced by our research?
- Does the human material in a collection hold special religious or social significance for a community?
- Is this collection under repatriation calls? 
- Were there credible attempts to identify stakeholders, especially for otherwise considered “unaffiliated” remains?
- Are relevant communities (see also next section), in the country of origin or elsewhere, aware of the items in possession of the museum/collection? If not, why not?

In the end, different ethical priorities of individuals, research teams and institutions may result in contrasting personal judgements whether or not to proceed with analyses. As an example, a collection that has received scrutiny in recent years in Germany is the large skull collection founded by German anthropologist and anatomist Rudolf Virchow from Berlin, which comprises specimens from a variety of backgrounds. Some members of our research group feel that it is fine to work on certain elements of this collection, excluding those whose collection violated basic human rights by today’s standards or insufficiently clear provenience. Similarly, some argue that archaeological/archaeogenetic analyses, such as radiocarbon dating and genetic information, can contribute to illuminating age or origin ascribed to a sample. Others believe that the use of any elements of such collections should be avoided or used solely for repatriation purposes, since one cannot use the remains without naming the collection. Using them would continue to credit a person or institution that have themselves committed, or encouraged others to commit, crimes against humanity to acquire some of the elements in the collection.

## Consultation of involved communities
Scientists studying human biological material have to be sensitive to the rights and interests of communities who derive part of their cultural identity from association with the finds under question. The existence and specifications of laws governing the study of (indigenous) human remains are variable across countries, and often associated with the country’s (colonial) history. One example is the Native American Grave Protection Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in the United States that protects Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony found on federally owned land, and requires change of ownership to the descendants and culturally affiliated groups. Similarly, the Australian Commonwealth law protects indigenous heritage sites and objects, including human remains.

In many cases, specific legislation guiding interactions with involved communities is not available, while other national and international guidelines are available for guidance, such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous people. Under Article 11.1 it ensures the right of indigenous people to “protect the past [...] such as archaeological sites [... and ] artifacts”, and Article 12.1 guarantees the “right to the repatriation of their human remains”. Further, it grants indigenous peoples control over “all manifestations of their science, including [...] genetic resources“ (Article 31.1), and demands that “States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of those rights” (Article 31.2) and “consult and cooperate [...] to obtain [indigenous peoples’] free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their [...] resources.” (Article 32.2). This also applies when national laws are in violation of human rights or international guidelines and more holistic guidelines should be respected voluntarily and additional consent sought from indigenous representatives. The language in the United Nations Declaration suggests that, while scientists seeking collaboration on analyses of indigenous remains should generally also work with state agencies (who “shall take effective measures to recognise and protect the exercise of those rights”), we do have responsibility ourselves to ensure that sampling and analysis is in line with indigenous rights. This will sometimes require direct engagement with indigenous communities even if this would not be required by the processes designed by national legislation. Such engagement holds for any community who derives part of its  cultural identity from association with the finds under question (Fox and Hawks 2019).

- In general, researchers, as part of collaborative teams, should consult with communities to determine if the analysis of human remains associated with their community justifies the disturbance of the remains. When appropriatepossible, group or collective consent, i.e. the community is informed about the research and consents to it (Hudson 2009), should be acquired prior to working with human remains that are claimed by the indigenous community.
- The indigenous communities and their rights and interests should also be considered in the interpretation of the results. The population affiliation (ethnicity, ethnic identity, descendant status) of human remains needs to be acknowledged and recognized in a culturally responsible manner that acknowledges the values and identity of the descendant communities. When possible, research teams should make the results of their study available to the associated communities prior to publication and in easily accessible, non-academic language. 
- Genetic data has a lot of weight as a line of evidence, and in some cases has resulted in the disagreement between the data and the cultural and oral histories of certain communities. In cases like this, research teams should critically engage and acknowledge that oral traditions can live parallel to the findings derived from methods in Science, which privileges Western points of view.
