# Introduction

Archaeogenetics is a research field at the interface of the natural sciences (mainly genetics) and humanities (mainly archaeology). As such, it not only inherits the ethical aspects inherent to each field, but also through their combination generates new questions, such as: How do we balance the need to preserve archaeological material as cultural heritage and the need to destructively sample such material in order to study it? How do we navigate between different stakeholders and interests when our data infringes on group identities? How do we interpret and communicate models of “genetic ancestry” without contributing to unscientific myths of national origins or race theories? 

This text summarises such questions in archaeogenetic research, discussed by the Ethics Interest group of the Department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena (MPI-SHH), Germany. This group was formed by junior and senior scientists in the department in response to internal and external demands to engage with these questions, and to continuously educate ourselves on ethical matters of our research. While projects and opinions within our group are diverse, we all felt the need to improve our understanding on ethical questions and on how to conduct our research responsibly. This discussion started out in December 2018 and received further input and comments from all members of the Department of Archaeogenetics and invited guests. 

We acknowledge that we contribute to the issues in our field. With that in mind we believe that it is important that we participate in this discussion from inside the field, which gives us a different perspective on the subject, in contrast to external institutions such as government bodies, ethical review boards, grant agencies, or science journalists. We understand this text not as a comprehensive lecture but as a reflective piece and a conversation starter to discuss how we can do better moving forward.

This is a living text. As a consequence, it will be further updated through future releases. Changes will be indicated in a Changelog at the top of this document. We have structured this document along key topics that we have identified, which can be read and discussed independently, or as a whole. Each section contains a general introduction and discussion of the key problems, as we have experienced them, and also tries to give recommendations on appropriate approaches to dealing with them and aspirations we have for the field (“Best practices”). These recommendations are highly subjective and represent our opinions only.

This document thus serves three purposes:
- Serve as a living discussion record within our department and as a basis for discussion also beyond our department.
- Serve as an educational resource for new students or junior researchers entering the field, here or elsewhere.
- Communicate to our scientific partners, and to the general public, some of the issues we face and the actions we recommend.

This document is a living document. As a consequence, it will be further updated through future releases. Changes will be indicated in a Changelog at the top of this document. While its first release marks a time point where we are comfortable to share the current status of our discussion, the discussions continue, and the publication is an invitation to join us in the discussion and challenge our views and ideas.
